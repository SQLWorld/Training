            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--text);">
                At Sunshine AI Academy, we believe that Artificial Intelligence is a fundamental shift in how humans
                work and create.
                Our mission is to democratize access to high-quality AI education, bridging the gap between theoretical
                research and practical industry application.
                We strive to foster a community of ethical, skilled, and visionary practitioners who will shape the
                future of technology.

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                Founded in 2024, Sunshine AI Academy started as a small meetup group in Washington, D.C. for developers
                interested in the emerging field of Generative AI.
                Recognizing a severe lack of structured, hands-on training, the founders formalized the curriculum and
                opened the first cohort in early 2025.
                Today, we have trained over 500 graduates who have gone on to work at top tech companies and innovative
                startups.
